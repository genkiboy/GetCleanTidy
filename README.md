Input data are read from './UCI HAR Dataset/', where '.' represents
the R working directory. The dataset includes the following files:

#### A. Test data
  1. 'test/X_test.txt': Test set containing ~30% of total data. Each row contains a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
  1. 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. Each row identifies the activity number (1 - 6) for each row in X_test.txt.
  1. 'train/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each row in X_test.txt.

#### B. Training data
  1. 'train/X_train.txt': Training set containing ~70% of total data. Each row contains a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
  1. 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. Each row identifies the activity number (1 - 6) for each row in X_train.txt.
  1. 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each row in X_train.txt.

#### C. General data (i.e., "lookup tables")
  1. 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels (ie, in y_test.txt and t_train.txt) with their activity names.
  1. 'features.txt': List of all 561 "features" or measures in the data sets.

## How the analysis code works
  1. Read in necessary R libraries (dplyr, tidyr, and reshape2)
  1. Read in all Test data files (see A. Test data above).
    1. Rename field "V1" in y_test.txt to "actNo"
    2. Rename field "V1" in subject_test.txt to "subNo"
    3. Combine the three files into one data frame named "test" using dplyr::bind_cols
    4. Add field "subgroup" with value "Test" to indicate these data came from the Test data set
  1. Read in all Training data files (see B. Training data above).
    1. Rename field "V1" in y_training.txt to "actNo"
    2. Rename field "V1" in subject_training.txt to "subNo"
    3. Combine the three files into one data frame named "train" using dplyr::bind_cols
    4. Add field "subgroup" with value "Training" to indicate these data came from the Training data set
  1. Combine data frames "test" and "train" into single data frame named "full" using dplyr::bindrows
