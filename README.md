Input data are read from './UCI HAR Dataset/', where '.' represents
the R working directory. The dataset includes the following files:

#### A. Test data
  1. 'test/X_test.txt': Test set containing ~30% of total data. Each row contains a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
  1. 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. Each row identifies the activity number (1 - 6) for each row in X_test.txt.
  1. 'train/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each row in X_test.txt.

#### B. Training data
  1. 'train/X_train.txt': Training set containing ~70% of total data. Each row contains a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
  1. 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. Each row identifies the activity number (1 - 6) for each row in X_train.txt.
  1. 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each row in X_train.txt.

#### C. General data (i.e., "lookup tables")
  1. 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels (ie, in y_test.txt and t_train.txt) with their activity names.
  1. 'features.txt': List of all 561 "features" or measures in the data sets.

## How the analysis code works
  1. Read in necessary R libraries (dplyr, tidyr, and reshape2)
  1. Read Test data files (see A. Test data above) into data frames xTest, yTest, and subTest, respectively
    1. Rename field "V1" in yTest to "actNo"
    2. Rename field "V1" in subTest to "subNo"
    3. Combine the three data frames into single df named "test" using dplyr::bind_cols
    4. Add field "subgroup" with value "Test" to indicate these data came from the Test data set
  1. Read in all Training data files (see B. Training data above) into data frames xTrain, yTrain, and subTrain, respectively
    1. Rename field "V1" in yTrain to "actNo"
    2. Rename field "V1" in subTrain to "subNo"
    3. Combine the three data frames into single df named "train" using dplyr::bind_cols
    4. Add field "subgroup" with value "Training" to indicate these data came from the Training data set
  1. Get activity labels data
    1. Read activity labels file (C.1. above) into data frame "actLabels"
    1. Change field names in data frame "actLabels" to "actNo" and "Activity"
  1. Combine data frames
    1. Combine data frames "test" and "train" into single df named "full" using dplyr::bindrows
    1. Merge df "actLabels" into "full" so that column full.Activity contains activity names
  1. Get measure names (or "features")
    1. Read features file (C.2. above) into data frame "features"
    2. Rename fields V1 and V2 as "varNo" and "varName", respectively
    3. Create new character variable "varNew" by combining the letter "V" with field varNo without a separator
    4. Create factor variable "variable" from varNew
  1. Create data frame "fullMelt" for analysis
    1. Melt df "full", retaining as id variables subNo, actNo, Activity, and subgroup
    2. Merge in df "features" (on field "variable") so that column fullMelt.varName contains measure names
    3. Filter out all values of varName except the following:
      1. Values containing the character string "-mean()"
      2. Values containing the character string "-std()"
    4. Select columns subNo, Activity, subgroup, value, and varName (i.e., dropping the rest)
  1. Create data frame "finalData" as grouped means of "fullMelt"
    1. Group df fullMelt by subNo, Activity, and varName using dply::group_by
    2. Change field name varName to "Measure"
    3. Calculate group means (as field "meanValue") using dplyr::summarize
  1. Write data frame finalData to output file "KES_GetClean_Step5_Tidy.txt
